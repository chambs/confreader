## Webpack + React + Babel Boilerplate

This simple boilerplate brings together webpack as the bundler, by using ES6
with Babel and React.

Additionally, the boilerplate is intended to provide unit tests with Karma and
Jasmine.

### How to use

1. Simply checkout the repo and run:

    `$ npm i`

1. Start the app for development with:

    `$ npm start`

  This will:

    * Build sources from `/src`
    * Start a web server under http://localhost:8080
